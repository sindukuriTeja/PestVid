## 🚨 **Important Notes**

### **⚠️ Production Considerations:**
- **Password Hashing**: Currently passwords are stored in plain text. In production, use proper hashing (bcrypt, etc.)
- **Email Verification**: Add email verification for new registrations
- **Password Reset**: Implement forgot password functionality
- **Rate Limiting**: Add protection against brute force attacks
- **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production

### **🔧 Customization:**
- **Add More Countries**: Extend the countries array in `initializeCountries()`
- **Add More States**: Extend the state data in `loadStates()`
- **Custom Fields**: Add more registration fields as needed
- **Validation Rules**: Modify validation in `register()` method
